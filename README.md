My collection of scripts to auto-download the latest of various well-behaved podcasts online that are my favorites.

I currently known [and script] a couple of Podcasts that are well behaved, and for which I don wanna miss a thing:

-- Sacred Dub (All Esoteric Dub variants -- Bill Laswell)

-- Hard With Style (HardStyle)

-- The Imaginarium Podcast (Melodic Dubstep)
